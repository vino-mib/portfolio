      "description": "This app allows Data scientists to experiment with various machine learning models, Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance, and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for each experiment before finding the best fit model for specific business use case.  I am responsible for designing architectural changes, developing the angular frontend and BFF APIs, writing unit and integration tests, containerizing the application with Docker, and deploying it to Kubernetes. The challenge I tackled was migrating this app to Kubernetes.  I successfully moved it from CloudFront and Lambda, deployed it to Kubernetes as a Knative service. This resulted in faster transaction times and reduced costs.",

It helps optimize conference room availability by prompting users to confirm their bookings upon arrival. If a reserved room remains unchecked within the first seven minutes of a meeting, it's automatically released for others to use. This system also allows for spontaneous 'takeovers' of unoccupied booked rooms, maximizing space utilization. I lead a team of developers, ensuring the delivery of high-quality code through responsive design, unit testing, and performance tuning.",
